1) Using aggregare function inside window function for ordering-
can only use it if the aggregate function is actually used in the query

eg. SELECT customer_id, product_id, product_name 
FROM
(SELECT customer_id, p.product_id, p.product_name, count(order_id),
DENSE_RANK() over (partition by customer_id order by count(order_id) desc) as dr
FROM orders o join products p
ON (o.product_id= p.product_id)
GROUP BY customer_id, p.product_id, p.product_name)
WHERE dr=1
